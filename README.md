# Student-Table
I have made this project by using HTML, CSS, BootStrap and JPDB database.

Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:-

Multi-mode DBMS - Document DB, Key-Value DB, RDBMS support.
Server side Native NoSQL - best query performance.
It is low level (raw) form of data and is also human readable.
Simplest way to retrieve data in a JSON format.
Web-services API - Can be used with any programming language that has support for HTTP.
It is built on top of one of the fastest and real-time data indexing engine - PowerIndeX.
It helps developers in faster coding, in-turn reduces development cost.
